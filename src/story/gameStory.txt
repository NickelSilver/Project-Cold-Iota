The story so far:
	Satyst lays in his bed tossing and turning unable to sleep.  It's been centuries since he was last able to sleep.  He gets outs of his bed and gazes into his portal into another realm spying on all the strange fleshy creatures sleeping soundly in their beds.  He comes across one in particular snuggled up with a stuffed creature, and instantly fills with jealous.  He must possess that stuffed creature.  He whisks through the portal, sneaks up on the child (Somnolous) and stealthily steals away with the child's stuffed bear.  The child awakes as Satyst leaps through the portal, just conscious enough to realize his favorite stuffy is gone.  Immediately, he springs out of bed and follows through the portal.
