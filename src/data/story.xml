        <text>Satyst lays in his bed tossing and turning unable to sleep.
        </text>
        <text>
            It's been centuries since he was last able to sleep.
        </text>
        <text>
            He gets outs of his bed and gazes into his portal into another realm
            spying on all the strange fleshy creatures sleeping soundly in their beds.
        </text>
            He comes across one in particular snuggled up with a stuffed creature,
            and is instantly filled with jealousy.
        <text>
            He must possess that stuffed creature.
        </text>
        <text>
            He whisks through the portal, sneaks up on the child (Somnolous)
        </text>
        <text>
            and stealthily steals away with the child's stuffed bear.
        </text>
        <text>
            The child awakes as Satyst leaps through the portal,
            just conscious enough to realize his favorite stuffy is gone.
        </text>
        <text>
            Immediately, he springs out of bed and follows through the portal.
